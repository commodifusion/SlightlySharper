SlightlySharper
===============

A keybinding add-in to make MonoDevelop behave slightly more like JetBrains Resharper or IDEA.


Installing from MonoDevelop (2.8+)
----------------------------------

Go to the 'Tools' menu and select 'Add-in manager' and click the 'Gallery' tab. SlightlySharper can be found
in 'MonoDevelop add-in repository (beta channel)' in the 'IDE Extensions' section.

After installation, you can find additional keybinding(s) in 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Keybinding' -> Schemes.
The first one added is 'IDEA'.


Building / installing locally
-----------------------------

Clone from the git repository:

	git clone git://github.com/commodifusion/SlightlySharper.git

Then read `SlightlySharper/INSTALL.txt`.


Reporting problems
------------------

SlightlySharper only provides keybindings (and perhaps a few small tweaks to the way MonoDevelop works).
There is no significant additional functionality in SlightlySharper - hence the name.

Bug reports for keybindings that are wrong, or suggestions for keys we could bind to existing MonoDevelop
functions and contributions of related keybindings or code tweaks are all welcome. Please use the Github
[issue tracker](https://github.com/commodifusion/SlightlySharper/issues) or send us a
[pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
