Most users should install SlightlySharper from MonoDevelop:

Go to the 'Tools' menu and select 'Add-in manager'.
SlightlySharper can be found in the 'IDE Extensions' section.


If you want to build and install SlightlySharper locally, these are the steps:

1. Build the solution

2. Build an .mpack file for the add-in by running:

$ mdtool setup pack CommodiFusion.Sharpener.addin.xml

3. In MonoDevelop, 'Tools', 'Add-in manager', 'Install from file' and select the .mpack from step 2.
